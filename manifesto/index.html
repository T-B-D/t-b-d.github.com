	<h1>TBD Manifesto</h1>
	<p>Companies and organizations face an ever-advancing set of business challenges, many of which are addressable by technology. Wether it be the Human Genome Project or your local product faults database, there is a wealth of open and proprietary data sources, technologies and efforts that constitute an increasingly important asset for anyone that can harness it with meaningful visualization, analytics and connections to other data. However, many businesses do not have the means or bandwidth to access the knowledge and talent needed to make this happen. But they have a good view of the value of these solutions.</p>
	<p>Innovators are coding in coffee shops, tinkering in garages and experimenting in labs and on campuses. How do they know up front if their ideas will be of value to enterprises or society at large? Their efforts need early validation and guidance from potential customers on what the market really needs and who are willing to fund and implement new technologies that solve critical issues.</p>
	<p>TBD aims to create local ecosystems that bring together industry with talented, entrepreneurial problem-solvers - developers, hackers, designers, thought leaders and academics - to tackle real world challenges in a creative and free environment. Through virtual and real time events, activities and collaborative platforms, TBDâ€™s goal is to bridge and facilitate spontaneous collaboration between individuals, businesses and organizations and access to potential customers willing to engage for innovators, developers and startups.</p>
