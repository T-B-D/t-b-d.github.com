<h1>TBD</h1>
<h2>Hackaton, February 10-12, 2012</h2>
<p>
TBD is all about what is To Be Done.
TBD’s hackathon is about making it happen - build an app, a product, a company over a weekend.
Here is how is works: show up Friday afternoon and pitch your startup idea to the group or hear from industry players (Sony Ericson, Rimm, etc) what they’d like to see hackers produce for them.  
Break into teams and code like hell for two days.
Build a prototype.
Demo your project on Sunday night to a panel of judges - founders, funders, industry experts.
Your team may win first prize.  Or even find a first customer.

Come get plugged in to the hottest startup event in Malmö.

<h2>Manifesto</h2>
<p>
Companies and organizations face an ever-advancing set of business challenges, many of which are addressable by technology.  Today, enterprises of all sizes are clamoring to deal with big data problems, are moving away from on premise software and toward Software as a Service and are finding new ways to engage customers via social channels.  Tomorrow, these issues will have mature solutions and the market will discover the next disruptive concepts in need of commercialization.</p>

<p>Innovators are coding in coffee shops, tinkering in garages and experimenting in labs and on campuses.  How do they know up front if their ideas will be of value to enterprises or society at large?  Their efforts need early validation and guidance from potential customers on what the market really needs and who are willing to fund and implement new technologies that solve critical issues.</p>

<p>TBD aims to create local ecosystems that bring together industry with talented, entrepreneurial problem-solvers - developers, designers, thought leaders and academics - to tackle real world business challenges.  Through virtual and real time events, activities and collaborative platforms, TBD’s goal is to create timely, cost effective and fun innovation for businesses and organizations and access to potential customers willing to engage for innovators, developers and startups.
