	<h1>Make it happen!</h1>
	<p>TBD is all about what is To Be Done. TBD’s hackathon is about making it happen - build an app, a product, a company over a weekend. Here is how is works: show up Friday afternoon and pitch your startup idea to the group or hear from industry players what they’d like to see hackers produce for them. Break into teams and code like hell for two days. Build a prototype. Demo your project on Sunday night. Your team may win first prize. Or even find a first customer. Come get plugged in to the hottest startup event in Malmö!</p>
